# Speedrun Ethereum - ðŸ”µ SVG NFT challenge solution
version: 0.1.0

## random ideas to pursue
* pivot threads
* symmetry
* any UI improvements (theming, features, interactions)
* don't see real case for limiting of generation
* somewhat interesting to research what sets won't be generated and probability/tendency for repeating itself; also if it's a good idea to generate out of tokenId
* stretch to Blockie alternative?

### colors / palette
* good (human) colors
* solve colors duplication gracefully; it's not good to see duplicates in the descr, but there should be way (?) to find out the sequence programmatically
* would be nice to microformat colors or find names for them, or smtg like that
