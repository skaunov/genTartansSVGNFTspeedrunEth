# Speedrun Ethereum - ðŸ”µ SVG NFT challenge solution
version: 0.1.0

## random ideas to pursue
* does this token need any kind of generation limiting like other projects did?
* somewhat interesting to research what sets won't be generated and probability/tendency for repeating itself; also if it's a good idea to generate out of tokenId
* could it be modified to be an interesting alternative for things like Blockie?

### visuals
* any UI improvements (theming, features, interactions)
#### make NFTs to look more like tartans that are present in real world
* _pivot threads_: set proportions closer to that are popular in tartans
* add some symmetry to please the eyes

### colors / palette
* do something with color generation so that palette would consist of more good (for humans) colors; maybe also pick out of supplimentary colors to one or two main ones
* solve colors duplication gracefully; it's not good to see duplicates in the descr, but there should be (or not?) way to find out the sequence programmatically
* would be nice to microformat colors or find names for them, or smtg like that to avoid just a string of hexes
